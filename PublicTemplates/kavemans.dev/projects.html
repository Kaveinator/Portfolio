              Tech Academy is a school located in the downtown region of Portland, Oregon and offers several bootcamps to choose from. I choose the "C# and .NET Bootcamp" since I have worked with C# before and I want to pursue a career as a Junior C#/.NET Developer.

            <span>
              Built a server with a team of 4 members for Tanki X. Was in charge of building in-game client
              authentication, cross-server communication and central server. Used Entity Framework with MySQL as the storage
              provider. The central server was reponsible for storing user data, authenticating game servers, balancing players
              based on overall volume or server volume and relaying broadcasts to all active servers. And built a small
              dashboard to keep track of statistics.

            <span>
              Built a web application for a decentralized chat platform for a Skynet competition.
              Looked and functioned very similiar to Discord or Slack, except not tied to a central location.
              Design is fluid and supports switching from mobile/desktop/portrait view.
              Also built an electron client which included a few tweaks to make the app look and feel more smooth.

              A game built with Unity3D using the C# language. On server side, uses Entity Framework with
              SQLite as the storage engine. Client authentication works by sending a RESTful API to the
              AuthServer that then returns a AuthToken and Guid combination to log into game servers. This
              project is still in development

            <span>
              Inspired by one of my older projects based in node.js, I rebuilt the HTTP server that featured server-side rendering and server-side event callbacks.
              I also made ExperimentalSQL, which is a library similar to Entity Framework except based on a based on ADO.NET implementation and is constrained to use SQLite3.

            <span>
              Built a web application for a learning platform in two weeks.
              Backend utilized a node.js server and MySQL storage to get and store channels, courses and content links.
              Frontend was built with HTML/CSS and Javascript (vanilla), was complete with a course catalog and search.

              Frontend programmed in HTML/CSS with vanilla JS, Backend programmed in node.js and uses MySQL for data storage.
              This platform allowed you to create a static website, enable/disable your site, and allowed to enable/disable FTP access.
