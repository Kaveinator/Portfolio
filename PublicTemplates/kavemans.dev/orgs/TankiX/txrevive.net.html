            I designed a landing page for the project as a central location to download the game, and also has a leaderboard.

          <!--In Tanki X, there's a map called 'Old School' which is based on a map from its predecessor, Tanki Online, known as 'Boombox'.
          The Tanki X variant was situated in the middle of a thunderstorm with a dark rainy atmosphere and thunder ambient sounds.
          In the attempt to make the map more appealing and vibrant, we decided to make a new variant of the map, initially called 'SunnyBox'.
          Instead of being glommy, the map was now featured in the morning with morning dew, and hope for a new begining.
          The new map variant was not only for visual appeal, it had some tactical merit, since the fog cleared, it was more optimal to start using weapons with higher range.-->

            Since the game is based on Unity Game Engine, the new map had to be made in Unity.
            I opted to use Unity 2017.2.5f1 which was the latest version of Unity that has proper backwards compatability with Unity 5.6.7 - the version of Unity when the game was built.

            <li>.. build the Madness map with 1,817 props with 23 prop variants</li>
            <li>.. define 140 spawn locations, 56 bonus regions and 2 flag locations</li>
            <li>.. create and placed 44 Halloween decorations including 36 floating pumpkins, 5 destroyed tanks and 3 evil laughing pumpkins</li>
            <li>.. create the pumpkin goldbox, spawn marker and broken pumpkin model used upon collecting the goldbox</li>
            <li>.. bake lighting multiple times to make the maps lighting seem more immersed <em>(takes a relativly long time per iteration)</em></li>

            C# <em>(pronounced Sea-Sharp)</em> is an <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" target="_blank">Object Oriented Programming <em>(OOP)</em></a> language that was developed by Microsoft in 1999.
            The Unity3D engine can be programmed using C# targetting .NET Framework 4.7.2.
            In this project, I built several console applications that served as utilities and tools for the project.

            <li>.. a script that built a map configuration for the server</li> <!-- the configuration compiler that wrote spawnpoints, bonuses and other data into json -->

            Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which is used to track changes to a codebase over time.
            GitHub is a centralized service owned by Microsoft that lets developers easily collaborate with each other.
            This project used multiple <em>private</em> GitHub reposisitories and utlized GitHub Projects to track changes, work items and issues.
