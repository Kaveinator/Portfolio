        <h2>Overview<span>The motive behind this project</span></h2>
        <div class="dynamicMargin">
          Initially the app is in a main menu state, asking for your name and what balance you want to start off with. Since we didn't implement any other game it creates a round of Blackjack, every player is then asked to hit or stay. The player with the highest hand that is not over 21 wins
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Abstract Player Implementation</strong> - There are multiple layers of abstraction, from the base Player class that is tied to each Game<T1, T2> object. This lets the BlackjackDealer also be a Blackjack player and able to hit/stay without extra logic in the core game itself</li>
            <li><strong>Input Validation</strong> - Players can interact with the game through a simple text-based interface, which has support to parse any value from a bool to a enum with a custom ReadNumeral<T> extension</li>
            <li><strong>Card Handling</strong> - The game simulates a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with functionalities for shuffling and dealing cards to players and the dealer</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring System</strong> - The game is aware of the Ace card that can either be a one or eleven</li>
            <li><strong>Error Prevention</strong> - Basic error handling ensures that the game gracefully handles invalid user input and other unexpected situations through TryDraw(out) methods, which also helps nested try/catches and makes handling much easier</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling</strong> - In the event of an error, the application self-reports exceptions (including unhandled/uncaught) onto a SQL Server via ADO.NET</li>

            <li>.. wrote a Console Extension allowing to read Enums and Numerals from the console <em>with</em> validation</li>

            Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which is used to track changes to a codebase over time.
            GitHub is a centralized service owned by Microsoft that lets developers easily collaborate with each other.
            This project pushed changed to a central repository where I kept C# Projects. It is public, so you can see the source code
