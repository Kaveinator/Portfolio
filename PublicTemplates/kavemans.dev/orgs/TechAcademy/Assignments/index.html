        <div class="dynamicMargin">
          I made this project when I got frustrated having to create a new project per assignment.
          From my perspective <em>(as a student)</em> it be a more practical to grade assignment when they were in a single C# project instead of switching between projects to evaluate each assignment.
          <p>
            Each assignment is a class that must inherit <kbd>IAssignment</kbd>, and define its StepId and Name. Once the user wants to test an assignment, <kbd>Invoke()</kbd> is called to run the assignment
          </p>
          <p>
            I made this program from a students perspective, what seems practical in my sense did not seem practical from a instructors viewpoint. I reverted to making separate projects per assignment, but I assume the instructors had an automated method for testing and in this context it was impractical to use an application with non-constant indexes (since the latest assignment would become the first assignment in the listing, bumping all other assignments lower)

            Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which is used to track changes to a codebase over time.
            GitHub is a centralized service owned by Microsoft that lets developers easily collaborate with each other.
            This project pushed changed to a central repository where I kept C# Projects. It is public, so you can see the source code
