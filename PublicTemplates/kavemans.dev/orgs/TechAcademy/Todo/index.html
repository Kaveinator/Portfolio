        <h2>Overview<span>The motive behind this project</span></h2>
        <div class="dynamicMargin">
          This project focused more on states, you can create, modify, start, pause, close and reopen tasks.
          The point of this project was to learn how to store persistent states in the browser.
          Generally, browsers do not store information about the site state when you restart.
          You can store persistent data in the browser by using the browsers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">Local Storage</a> which
          allows information to be stored in the browser instead of a server.
          There are a few things I would fix if I was going to reimplement or update this page.
          Some browsers pause execution of scripts on tabs that are inactive, this causes the stopwatch to not be reliable since events are not getting fired.
          Another issue is with how I store data, I store the time elapsed, but if you have a task "ongoing" its timer wouldn't be counting, since that relied on
          the stopwatch events which are not available when the site is closed. A more reliable approch, would be to store the datetime of the last recorded state
          and time elapsed so that it can fast forward and update the time after you load the page.

          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>
          <span>
            HTML is used to define the general hierarchy and relationships between elements on a webpage.
            HTML itself, usually doesn't look very presentable and looks like a something you'd find in the 90s, so you'll need to use CSS to add color.

          <span>
            CSS is used in combination with HTML, it is used to "paint" the canvas that was built with HTML.
            However, CSS is not a programming language and does not provide any programmable functionality.

          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>
          <span>
            Javascript can be utilized to provide functionality and programmable logic to webpages, 
            it can make a popup open alerting that you have unsaved changes or process a login request.
            Javascript can also be utilized on the backend (server) that can process data sent by clients,
            this project only utilized client-side javascript.

            Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which is used to track changes to a codebase over time.
            GitHub is a centralized service owned by Microsoft that lets developers easily collaborate with each other.
            This project pushed changed to a central repository where I kept C# Projects. It is public, so you can see the source code
