        <div class="dynamicMargin">
          This project was not an assignment given by the instructors or the learning platform.
          I originally came up with the idea when I was grilling and wanted a timer that restarted as soon as it elapsed, while still playing a tone.
          The site visuals were built with HTML and CSS, with a seven segment font. It would be pretty much impossible to make a configurable timer without
          the user of Javascript, I didn't use any frameworks or libraries, the client-side script parses the query in the URL and sets the timer, from there
          you can start and stop the restarting timer as you'd like. You can see the live demo <a href="./Beeper/demo?m=1">here</a>.

          <span>
            HTML is used to define the general hierarchy and relationships between elements on a webpage.
            HTML itself, usually doesn't look very presentable and looks like a something you'd find in the 90s, so you'll need to use CSS to add color.

          <span>
            CSS is used in combination with HTML, it is used to "paint" the canvas that was built with HTML.
            However, CSS is not a programming language and does not provide any programmable functionality.

          <span>
            Javascript can be utilized to provide functionality and programmable logic to webpages, 
            it can make a popup open alerting that you have unsaved changes or process a login request.
            Javascript can also be utilized on the backend (server) that can process data sent by clients,
            this project only utilized client-side javascript.
