            <span>
              A game built with Unity3D using the C# language. On server side, uses Entity Framework with
              SQLite as the storage engine. Client authentication works by sending a RESTful API to the
              AuthServer that then returns a AuthToken and Guid combination to log into game servers. This
              project is still in development

            <span>
              Built a server with a team of 4 members for Tanki X. Was in charge of building in-game client
              authentication, cross-server communication and central server. Used Entity Framework with MySQL as the storage
              provider. The central server was reponsible for storing user data, authenticating game servers, balancing players
              based on overall volume or server volume and relaying broadcasts to all active servers. And built a small
              dashboard to keep track of statistics.

              Design is fluid and supports switching from mobile/desktop/portrait view. Also built an electron client
              which included a few tweaks to make the app look and feel more smooth.
